# SPH

This project is the result of my research in Computing Fluid Dynamics using the method known as Smoothed Particles Hydrodynamics. Two cases were studied: the shock waves in the Sod's Tube and the heat transport in a rectangular plane. 
The first one stands for a one-dimensional case, where the goal was to test a simple way to write the SPH principles in an algorithm. So, the main file was built to get the inputs o
